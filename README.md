### Implementing the REST API Server

If you want to test the API before using it in a client application, run the server locally and then you can invoke the REST services straight from a browser address bar.

#### Run Locally

Go to http://nodejs.org and install NodeJS

###### Install all the dependencies:

    npm install (you may need to prefix this with sudo if you're on Mac)

###### Run the app:

    npm start

###### Then navigate to [http://localhost:8000/list](http://localhost:8000/list)
